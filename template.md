<sub>For now you can't put any text but the code. But here's the template. When you finish adding code run `python scan.py [.md file]`</sub>
```
print('the format looks something like this. make sure to add the incremental text output0')
```
output0
```
import os
print('you can put multiple amounts of code')
print("here's the files in the main location:",os.listdir())
```
output1
