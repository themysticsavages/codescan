For now you can only execute one code segment. But anyway, here's the template. When you finish adding code run `python scan.py [file]`.
So now you can put whatever text you want right with the code segment, which is great. So a normal use would be like this:

//
```
print('normal usage')
```
//
output

There you go that's how you use it.
Don't forget that you can do much more than simply print things, you can set variables, define functions, and import functions!
